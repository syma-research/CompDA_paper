This set of codes are used for reproducing all the simulations in the paper and real data application.

Simulation part:

The main script is run_simulation.m which is used to generate the data and estimate the parameters using the proposed method in the paer.

Within the parallel.m, two main functions are used:
1. biased_estimate_BIC
2. debiased_cvx
where the first one is used to obtain the original Lasso estimator with tuning parameter selected by the extended BIC and the second one is the de-biased procedure proposed in the paper.

get_MCC_all.m is used to generate the tables in the paper.

The R code is used to generate the plots.
1. plots.R is used to generate the plots in the paper which includes coverage probability and average length.
2. plots_more.R is used to generate more plots which are not included in the paper.


Notice:
1. To reproduce the result, one should first creat folders named as: simulation data, simulation result.
2. Before running to code in run_simulation.m, one need to first set the path to the folder where run_simulation.m is in.
3. In parallel.m, the number of cores used in parallel computing should be changed according to the PC used (can use parcluster function to check the number of local clusters).


For real data application part:

The code used for IBD data analysis is in the folder "IBD data analysis". The data used in our analysis is saved in IBD.csv and the IBD.mat, IBD_bac_name.mat are two matlab data files that store the data and bacteria names.

The main scripts are IBD_data_analysis.m and IBD_data_analysis_multi.m. The first one is used to perform analysis on the IBD dataset using single constraint and the second one is used for analysis using multiple constraint.

The allplot.m and allplots_multi.m files are used to preprocess data which will used later to generate the plots in the paper. The first one uses single constraint and the second one uses multiple constraints.

The stability.m and stability_multi.m files are used to perform stability analysis.

As for the R file, plots_IBD.R file is used to generate the plots in the paper and get_multiconstraint.R is used to generate the multiple constraints matrix.

The code used for sensitivity analysis of the IBD data is in the folder "IBD data analysis_sensitivity".


Notice:
1. Before running to code in the folder "IBD data analysis", one need to first set the path to the folder where the parallel.m is in.
2. To reproduce the result, one should first creat folders named as: plots, results.
3. In IBD_data_analysis.m, IBD_data_analysis_multi.m, the number of cores used in parallel computing should be changed according to the PC used.
